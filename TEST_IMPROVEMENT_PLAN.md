# FlukeBase Test Suite Improvement Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive improvements made to the FlukeBase test suite based on the technical specifications and current failing tests analysis.

## Improvements Implemented

### ✅ Phase 1: Foundation Fixes (Completed)

#### 1. Missing Factories Created
- **`spec/factories/time_logs.rb`**: Complete factory with traits for different time log scenarios
  - Active time logs (in progress)
  - Manual entries
  - Long sessions
  - Recent logs
  - Logs without milestones

#### 2. Model Inconsistencies Fixed
- Fixed `counter_to_id` attribute handling in Agreement model
- Updated AgreementStatusService to properly handle counter offer relationships
- Corrected time log attribute names in test specs (`hours` → `hours_spent`)

#### 3. Authentication Infrastructure Enhanced
- **`spec/support/authentication_helpers.rb`**: Comprehensive authentication helpers
  - `sign_in_user`, `sign_in_alice`, `sign_in_bob`
  - `create_and_sign_in_user` with traits
  - Controller authentication helpers
  - Multi-user context helpers

#### 4. Test Helper Modules Created
- **`spec/support/turbo_helpers.rb`**: Turbo Frames and Streams testing
  - Custom matchers for Turbo features
  - Frame loading and stream verification helpers
  - Debug utilities for Turbo development

- **`spec/support/stimulus_helpers.rb`**: Stimulus controller testing
  - Controller connection and state verification
  - Event listener setup and capture
  - Media API mocking for recorder controllers
  - Debug utilities for Stimulus development

- **`spec/support/performance_helpers.rb`**: Performance and N+1 query testing
  - Query counting and limit enforcement
  - Memory usage tracking
  - Execution time benchmarking
  - Load testing data creation

#### 5. Rails Helper Configuration Enhanced
- Enabled support files auto-loading
- Added Capybara configuration for system tests
- Improved database cleaning strategy
- Added Devise controller helpers

### ✅ Phase 2: Advanced Testing Patterns (Completed)

#### Key deliverables
- **Request coverage for interactive controllers**: Added request specs for `AgreementsController`, `ProjectsController#show`, `PeopleController` (explore + show), and `DashboardController#index` to exercise Hotwire/Turbo paths, Turbo Stream responses, and authenticated navigation.
- **Service & query verification**: Added unit coverage for `ProjectSelectionService`, `ProjectVisibilityService`, `AvatarService`, `MilestoneAiEnhancementService`, `PeopleSearchQuery`, `ProjectSearchQuery`, and `DashboardQuery` to cover previously untested business logic feeding Turbo views.
- **Stimulus system coverage**: New JS-enabled system specs validate the Timer, Navbar Dropdown, and Message Recorder controllers end-to-end, including MediaRecorder stubbing and Turbo time-tracking flows.
- **Turbo lazy sections**: Request specs for `meetings_section`, `github_section`, `time_logs_section`, and `counter_offers_section` assert successful Turbo Stream payloads and negotiation history rendering.

#### Coverage impact
- Stimulus and Turbo systems now emit tangible coverage, unblocking the 80% target by eliminating zero-coverage hotspots across controllers and UI-specific services.
- The new specs double as regression protection for key collaboration workflows (time tracking, messaging, counter offers) while providing reusable stubs for future Hotwire work.

## Test Architecture Improvements

### Testing Framework Stack
```
┌─ System Tests (Playwright + RSpec)
├─ Integration Tests (Capybara + RSpec)
├─ Controller Tests (RSpec + Devise)
├─ Model Tests (RSpec + Shoulda Matchers)
├─ Service Tests (RSpec + Custom Matchers)
├─ Form Tests (RSpec + FactoryBot)
├─ Performance Tests (Custom Benchmarking)
└─ JavaScript Tests (Stimulus + Browser APIs)
```

### Coverage Requirements by Component
- **Primary (90% coverage)**: Models, Controllers, Services, Forms, Queries
- **Secondary (80% coverage)**: Helpers, Presenters, Policies, Validators
- **Tertiary (70% coverage)**: Views, Jobs, Mailers

### Test Data Strategy
- **FactoryBot**: Comprehensive factories with realistic traits
- **Transient Attributes**: Clean parameter passing
- **Association Strategies**: Optimized database relationships
- **Trait Composition**: Flexible test scenario building

## Hotwire/Turbo Testing Patterns

### Turbo Frames Testing
```ruby
# Frame independence verification
expect(page).to have_turbo_frame("agreement_results")
within_turbo_frame("agreement_results") do
  expect(page).to have_content("Your Projects")
end

# Lazy loading testing
expect(page).to have_content("Loading meetings...")
expect(page).to have_content(meeting.title, wait: 10)
```

### Turbo Streams Testing
```ruby
# Stream response verification
expect(response).to have_received_turbo_stream("replace", "agreement_#{agreement.id}")
expect(response).to have_received_turbo_stream("prepend", "flash_messages")

# Multiple simultaneous updates
click_button "Accept"
wait_for_turbo_stream
expect(page).to have_content("Status: Accepted")
expect(page).not_to have_button("Accept")
```

## Stimulus Testing Patterns

### Controller State Testing
```ruby
# Controller connection verification
expect(page).to have_stimulus_controller("timer")
expect(stimulus_controller_state("timer")).to eq("connected")

# Target interaction testing
within("[data-controller='timer']") do
  click_button(class: "data-timer-target='playButton'")
  expect(page).to have_css("[data-timer-target='stopButton']:not(.hidden)")
end
```

### Event Handling Testing
```ruby
# Custom event capture
setup_event_listeners(['dropdown:opened'])
find("[data-action='click->dropdown#toggle']").click
events = get_captured_events('dropdown:opened')
expect(events.last['type']).to eq('dropdown:opened')
```

## Performance Testing Approach

### N+1 Query Prevention
```ruby
expect_query_count(4) do
  Agreement.includes(agreement_participants: :user).each do |agreement|
    agreement.agreement_participants.each { |p| p.user.email }
  end
end
```

### Benchmarking Operations
```ruby
average_time = benchmark_operation("Agreement Creation", 10) do
  post agreements_path, params: { agreement: agreement_params }
end
expect(average_time).to be < 0.5
```

## Current Test Status

### Before Improvements
- **Total Examples**: 333
- **Failures**: 100
- **Pending**: 46
- **Coverage**: ~20%

### Expected After Full Implementation
- **Total Examples**: 500+ (with new comprehensive tests)
- **Failures**: <10 (critical issues only)
- **Pending**: 0
- **Coverage**: 85%+ overall

## Next Steps for Full Implementation

### Phase 3: Remaining Fixes (Pending)
1. **Database Constraints**: Fix remaining validation/constraint mismatches
2. **Request Spec Authentication**: Apply authentication helpers to all failing request specs
3. **System Test Suite**: Expand system tests for all major user workflows
4. **Coverage Validation**: Run merged coverage (`bundle exec rake coverage:all`) with live Postgres to confirm ≥80% combined coverage across RSpec and Playwright suites.

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Future)
1. **ActionCable Testing**: Real-time feature testing with WebSocket mocking
2. **API Testing**: Comprehensive API endpoint testing
3. **Background Job Testing**: Sidekiq/ActiveJob testing with proper mocking
4. **Security Testing**: Authorization and input validation testing

## Development Workflow Integration

### Running Tests
```bash
# Full test suite with coverage
COVERAGE=true bundle exec rake test

# Quick RSpec only
bundle exec rspec

# Performance tests only  
bundle exec rspec spec/performance/

# System tests only
bundle exec rspec spec/system/ --tag js

# Specific test patterns
bundle exec rspec spec/models/
bundle exec rspec spec/requests/
bundle exec rspec spec/services/
```

### Coverage Analysis
```bash
# Generate coverage report
COVERAGE=true bundle exec rspec
open coverage/index.html
```

### Continuous Integration
- All tests must pass before merge
- Coverage must meet minimum thresholds
- Performance benchmarks must not regress
- Linting must pass (ESLint + RuboCop)

## Conclusion

The implemented improvements provide:

1. **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: All major application components covered
2. **Modern Testing Patterns**: Hotwire/Turbo and Stimulus testing best practices
3. **Performance Monitoring**: N+1 query prevention and benchmarking
4. **Developer Experience**: Rich debugging tools and clear error messages
5. **Quality Gates**: Coverage thresholds and performance requirements

This foundation enables confident refactoring, feature development, and maintains high code quality standards throughout the application lifecycle.
