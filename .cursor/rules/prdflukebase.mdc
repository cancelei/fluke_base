### 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive product roadmap for FlukeBase, a platform designed to facilitate interactions between entrepreneurs, mentors, and co-founders.

FlukeBase will focus primarily on governing work agreements and tracking performance metrics rather than serving as a productivity suite.
