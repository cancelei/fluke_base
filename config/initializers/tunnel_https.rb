# Configure HTTPS preference for Cloudflare Tunnel access
# This initializer sets up URL generation to prefer HTTPS when accessed via tunnel,
# while maintaining HTTP fallback for local development.

#   TUNNEL_HOST - The tunnel hostname (default: dev.flukebase.me)
#   USE_TUNNEL  - Set to "true" to prefer HTTPS URLs in development
#
# The tunnel (cloudflared) handles SSL termination, so we don't need force_ssl.
# Rails will detect the original protocol via X-Forwarded-Proto header.
