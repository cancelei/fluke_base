            FlukeBase supports two agreement types: <strong>Mentorship</strong> for advisory relationships and
            <strong>Co-founder</strong> for partnership arrangements. Each agreement can specify compensation expectations
            including hourly rates, equity percentages, or hybrid combinations. Agreements go through a negotiation
            process where parties can accept, reject, or counter-offer terms.

            <strong>No.</strong> Agreements on FlukeBase are organizational tools for tracking collaboration terms,
            compensation expectations, and progress. They are <strong>not legally binding contracts</strong> and
            should not be treated as such. If you need legally enforceable agreements, please consult with a
            qualified attorney to draft appropriate legal documents.

            Yes. FlukeBase has no role restrictions - all users can create their own projects while also

            simultaneously across different projects.

        <div class="collapse-content">
          <p class="text-base-content/80 leading-relaxed pt-2">
            Time tracking is tied to project milestones. You can start a timer while working on a specific milestone,
            and the logged time is recorded against that milestone. The interface updates in real-time without page
            reloads. You can also manually add time entries if needed.
