## 🚀 Testing Capabilities Enabled

### 1. Hotwire/Turbo Testing
```ruby
# Frame independence testing
expect(page).to have_turbo_frame("agreement_results")
within_turbo_frame("agreement_results") do
  expect(page).to have_content("Your Projects")
end

# Stream response verification
expect(response).to have_received_turbo_stream("replace", "agreement_#{agreement.id}")
wait_for_turbo_stream
```

### 2. Stimulus Controller Testing
```ruby
# Controller state verification
expect(page).to have_stimulus_controller("timer")
expect(stimulus_controller_state("timer")).to eq("connected")

# Event handling testing
setup_event_listeners(['dropdown:opened'])
events = get_captured_events('dropdown:opened')
```

### 3. Performance Testing
```ruby
# N+1 query prevention
expect_query_count(4) do
  Agreement.includes(:agreement_participants).each { |a| a.participants }
end

# Benchmarking operations
average_time = benchmark_operation("Agreement Creation", 10) do
  create(:agreement, :with_participants)
end
```

### 4. Authentication Testing
```ruby
# Flexible authentication helpers
sign_in_alice
sign_in_user(create(:user, :admin))
with_users(alice: true, bob: true)
```
